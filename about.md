My name is Darshan Ramakrishnan, and I am a physics undergraduate at Krea University with concentrations in Mathematics and Literature.
I am passionate about pursuing research to understand how complex systems in the universe—from neuronal networks to cosmic structures—evolve and function. My goal is to apply an interdisciplinary perspective, using physical, mathematical, and computational concepts to explore these fascinating problems.

This website serves as a portfolio for my academic and semi-personal projects and experiences. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me via LinkedIn or email.
